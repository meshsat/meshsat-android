# MeshSat Android -- Standalone Mobile Gateway & Reticulum Transport Node

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue)](LICENSE)
[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/meshsat/meshsat-android)](https://github.com/meshsat/meshsat-android/releases)

Native Android app that turns a phone into a standalone field gateway and full Reticulum Transport Node. Bridges Meshtastic mesh (BLE), Iridium satellite (9603N SBD + 9704 IMT), APRS, cellular SMS, and MQTT -- with end-to-end encryption, semantic compression, and intelligent routing.

The phone IS the gateway. No companion app, no server dependency, no internet required.

## Quick Start

### End Users -- Install from GitHub Releases

1. Download the latest signed APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/meshsat/meshsat-android/releases)
2. On your phone, enable **Settings > Security > Install unknown apps** for your browser
3. Open the downloaded `.apk` and tap **Install**
4. If Google Play Protect warns about an unknown developer, tap **Install anyway** -- the APK is signed (see [Release Signing](#release-signing) below)
5. Open MeshSat and grant the requested permissions (Bluetooth, Location, SMS, Notifications)

**Upgrading from v2.8.x or older:** from v2.9.0 the app's package name is `net.meshsat.android` (it was `com.cubeos.meshsat`). Android installs it as a separate app, and nothing carries over. Uninstall the old MeshSat, install the new one, and connect it to the Hub again with a provisioning QR code.

### Developers -- Build from Source

Requires Android SDK (compileSdk 35) and JDK 17.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meshsat/meshsat-android.git
cd meshsat-android
./gradlew assembleDebug
# APK at app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Grant Permissions

On first launch, MeshSat requests permissions for Bluetooth, Location, SMS, and Notifications. All are required for full functionality:

- **Bluetooth** -- connects to Meshtastic radios (BLE) and satellite modems (HC-05 SPP)
- **Location** -- required for BLE scanning on Android 12+, GPS position for map and beaconing
- **SMS** -- enables the cellular SMS gateway transport
- **Notifications** -- foreground service notification (Android 13+ requirement)
- **Foreground service types** (Android 14+): `connectedDevice` and `location` are declared in the manifest

### Step 2: Pair Your Radio

Open **Settings** and pair your Meshtastic radio via Bluetooth. The app scans for BLE devices advertising the Meshtastic service UUID. Tap your device to connect. Full radio configuration is available in the **Radio Config** tab (7 sub-tabs: Identity, LoRa, Channels, Position, Bluetooth, Network, Admin).

For satellite modems (RockBLOCK 9603N/9704), pair the HC-05 Bluetooth SPP adapter first via Android Bluetooth settings, then select it in MeshSat Settings.

### Step 3: Connect to Hub (Optional)

If you use [MeshSat Hub](https://hub.meshsat.net) for fleet management:

1. On the Hub web UI, generate a QR provisioning code for your device
2. In MeshSat, go to **Settings > Hub** and scan the QR code
3. The app auto-configures Hub URL, credentials, and mTLS certificates
4. Alternatively, paste the Hub URL and mTLS client certificate PEM manually in **Settings > Hub**

### Step 4: Configure Access Rules

Go to **Rules** to set up message routing between transports. Rules use Cisco ASA-style implicit deny with per-rule source/destination interface filtering, keyword/sender/node matching, object groups, failover groups, and rate limiting.

### Step 5: Send a Test Message

Open the **Comms** tab and send a test message to a Meshtastic node. If access rules route to a satellite interface, verify delivery in the **Delivery Ledger** (Rules > DLQ tab). Check the Dashboard sparklines for real-time activity.

## Reticulum Transport Node

MeshSat Android is a full Reticulum Transport Node -- not just a client. It relays packets between all interfaces, maintains a forwarding table with cost-aware routing, and announces itself to the mesh.

- **Ed25519 signing + X25519 encryption** identity
- **10+ Reticulum interfaces**: Meshtastic BLE, Iridium 9603, Iridium 9704, SMS, MQTT, TCP (HDLC), BLE peripheral (GATT server), Tor (SOCKS5), WireGuard
- **Cross-interface relay** with announce propagation and hop counting
- **3-packet ECDH link handshake** with AES-256-GCM encrypted links
- **Path table** with cost-aware forwarding and path request/response
- **TLS + mTLS** for authenticated TCP tunnel to Hub

## Meshtastic Integration

Full radio configuration via BLE (not just messaging):

- **15 portnums**: text, position, telemetry, routing ACK/NAK, waypoint, neighborinfo, traceroute, store-forward, range test, detection sensor, paxcounter, reply, nodeinfo, admin, private
- **7 config tabs**: Identity, LoRa (region/preset/TX power/hop limit), Channels (8 with PSK), Position (GPS/broadcast interval), Bluetooth, Network (WiFi), Admin (reboot/shutdown/factory reset)
- **Official protobuf bindings** from `meshtastic/protobufs` via `protobuf-javalite`
- **Single-parse dispatch** via `MeshtasticProtocol.parseFromRadioFull()` — one protobuf parse per frame, then adapter maps to internal types

## Security & Encryption

### Crypto

- **AES-256-GCM** per-conversation encryption for SMS
- **MSVQ-SC** lossy semantic compression (~92% savings) -- ONNX Runtime INT8 encoder (TX), pure Kotlin codebook decoder (RX)
- **Ed25519 hash-chain audit log** -- append-only, tamper-evident, viewable in the Audit screen with chain verification
- **ECDSA-P256 signed birth messages** for Hub device verification

### Master Key Envelope

Device-level at-rest encryption using Android's `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (AndroidX Security). All sensitive keys and credentials are wrapped with HKDF + AES-256-GCM key wrapping backed by the Android Keystore hardware.

### QR Key Bundles with TOFU Pinning

Cross-platform channel key exchange via `meshsat://key/` URI scheme. Scan a QR code from the Bridge or another Android device to import AES-256-GCM conversation keys for each channel (mesh, iridium, sms, etc.) in a single operation.

Starting in **v2.8.5**, `KeyBundleImporter` supports **TOFU (Trust On First Use)** pinning against the bridge's Ed25519 signing key:

- **Bundle v2 format** embeds the 32-byte Ed25519 signing pubkey inside the signed payload. Signature covers everything except the signature bytes themselves, so the pubkey cannot be swapped without invalidating the signature.
- **First import** from a new bridge hash → pubkey is pinned in the `bridge_trust` Room table, status `NEW_TRUSTED`.
- **Subsequent imports** → signature verified against the *stored* pubkey, status `EXISTING_TRUSTED`. A mismatch (key rotation or impersonation) is **rejected** and the user sees a KeyMismatch warning with an explicit re-pin option.
- **Bundle v1 (legacy)** still imports for backward compat with older bridges, flagged as `UNVERIFIED_V1` with a user-visible warning.

See MESHSAT-495 for the full design.

### Credential Management

The **Credentials** screen provides:
- PEM certificate import (paste or file picker) for Hub mTLS client certificates
- Certificate expiry monitoring with dashboard warnings
- Hub-distributed credential push/revoke via MQTT commands
- Encrypted storage of all certificate material

### Release Signing

All release builds (v2.8.0+) are signed via OpenBao secret management:
- **Keystore**: PKCS12, RSA 2048, 30-year validity (Play Store requires > 25), stored in OpenBao vault
- **Upload key alias**: `meshsat-upload`
- **CI pipeline**: GitLab JWT → OpenBao auth → fetches keystore → signed APK + AAB → uploaded to GitLab Package Registry and GitHub Releases

Verify any downloaded APK before installing:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs meshsat-android-X.Y.Z-release.apk
```

Expected output for all v2.8.0+ releases:

```
Signer #1 certificate DN: CN=MeshSat, OU=CubeOS, O=Nuclear Lighters, L=Leiden, ST=South Holland, C=NL
Signer #1 certificate SHA-256 digest: 8ca78b6c33bd9796bb05f40fec2a0ab801e0297e7565960d42f5e6af821c9f66
Signer #1 certificate SHA-1 digest:   9040570a7bf4d33890bf82ad85a7debf24fa57ab
```

All releases share the same upload key, so in-place upgrades work without uninstalling. Debug builds use the Android debug keystore and are not suitable for production.

## TAK / CoT Integration

MeshSat Android receives TAK Cursor on Target (CoT) position data from Hub via MQTT broadcast topic `meshsat/broadcast/tak/cot/in`. Incoming CoT XML is parsed and rendered as diamond markers on the osmdroid map alongside local Meshtastic nodes. This enables situational awareness of TAK-connected assets without running a full ATAK client on the phone.

TAK gateway (CoT XML server mode) is Bridge-only. Android is receive-only via Hub broadcast.

## Delivery Ledger & DLQ

Every outbound message is tracked in the `MessageDeliveryEntity` table with 10 status states: `queued`, `pending`, `sending`, `sent`, `delivered`, `failed`, `expired`, `cancelled`, `retrying`, `dead_letter`. The Rules screen includes a **DLQ Inspector** tab showing failed deliveries with retry controls and status history.

## Multi-Instance Transports

The `TransportRegistry` supports multiple instances of the same transport type (e.g., two HC-05 adapters for 9603N + 9704 simultaneously). Each instance has independent config, delivery workers, and health tracking. Backward compatible with singleton accessor patterns.

## Local REST API

NanoHTTPD server on `localhost:6051` with 14 endpoints:

| Category | Endpoints |

- SMS permission (for cellular gateway)
- Location permission (for GPS and BLE scanning on Android 12+)
- Notification permission (Android 13+, for foreground service)
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` (Android 14+, declared in manifest)
- ~35 MB free storage for ONNX model assets

## Supported Devices

### Phones (Tested)

| Device | Android | Status | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Google Pixel 9a | 16 (API 36) | **Primary** | BouncyCastle/Conscrypt, foreground service types, Room v13 migration, full E2E via wireless ADB |
| Android Emulator (API 30) | 11 | CI | Build verification on `nllei01androidsdk01` |

Other modern Android devices (Android 8.0+ / API 26+) should work — the app's only device-specific dependencies are Android's standard BLE, SMS, and Location APIs. If you test on another device, an issue report with your results is welcome.

## Troubleshooting

### Bluetooth / BLE

**Can't find Meshtastic radio during scan** -- Ensure Location permission is granted (required for BLE scanning on Android 12+). Check that the radio's Bluetooth is enabled and advertising. Try toggling Bluetooth off/on.

**BLE connects but disconnects immediately** -- Some Android OEMs aggressively kill background services. Add MeshSat to your battery optimization whitelist: Settings > Apps > MeshSat > Battery > Unrestricted.

**HC-05 SPP not pairing** -- Pair the HC-05 adapter in Android Bluetooth settings first (default PIN: 1234), then select it in MeshSat Settings. Ensure the HC-05 baud rate matches the modem (19200 for 9603N, 230400 for 9704).

### Foreground Service

**"MeshSat keeps stopping" on MIUI/OPPO/Samsung** -- These OEMs kill foreground services aggressively. Enable auto-start: Settings > Apps > MeshSat > Auto-start. On MIUI, also disable battery saver for MeshSat. See [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com) for device-specific instructions.

**Notification permission denied** -- On Android 13+, the foreground service notification requires explicit permission. Go to Settings > Apps > MeshSat > Notifications and enable.

### Play Protect / Sideloading

**"Blocked by Play Protect"** -- Tap **More details > Install anyway**. The APK is signed with our release key but not distributed via Play Store, so Play Protect flags it as unknown. Verify the signature: `apksigner verify --print-certs meshsat-*.apk`.

**"App not installed" error** -- Check that you have enough storage space (~85 MB for app + assets). If upgrading, ensure the new APK is signed with the same key as the installed version. Uninstall the old version first if signatures don't match.

### Satellite

**Iridium signal shows 0 bars** -- Ensure the HC-05 is paired and selected. Check antenna connections on the RockBLOCK. Requires clear sky view for signal acquisition.

**Messages stuck in "sending" state** -- Check the Delivery Ledger (Rules > DLQ tab). Iridium SBD requires a satellite pass. The PassScheduler will auto-flush the burst queue during the next predicted pass.

### Map

**Map tiles not loading (blank map)** -- On Android 16, ensure you're running v2.8.2+ which fixes a BouncyCastle/Conscrypt provider conflict that silently broke HTTPS tile downloads. If offline, osmdroid uses cached tiles from previous sessions.

### Performance

**First message compression is slow (~500ms)** -- This is the ONNX Runtime cold start. Subsequent compressions are fast. The encoder session is initialized lazily on first use.

## Changelog

### v2.8.x (Current)

- **v2.8.5** -- TOFU key pinning in `KeyBundleImporter`, bundle v2 format with embedded Ed25519 pubkey, `bridge_trust` Room table (MESHSAT-495). 11 new unit tests covering every TOFU path.
- **v2.8.4** -- Holistic transport state gates -- no I/O on disconnected devices, eliminated ~720 spurious warnings/hour on Iridium-less installs (MESHSAT-499). All 6 transport classes plus PassScheduler wire-up gated.
- **v2.8.3** -- PassScheduler ms/sec unit mismatch fix -- eliminated 1000× over-iteration OOM in the SGP4 propagation loop (MESHSAT-498). Verified on Pixel 9a Android 16: 51--84 ms per provider call.
- **v2.8.2** -- BouncyCastle JCA provider ordering fix -- restored Conscrypt SSL on Android 16 (MESHSAT-497). Unblocked map tiles, Hub TLS, mTLS, every HTTPS call in the app.
- **v2.8.1** -- osmdroid R8 keep rules (MESHSAT-493 -- kept as defensive but not the actual cause of blank tiles).
- **v2.8.0** -- Release signing with OpenBao + Play Store AAB pipeline (MESHSAT-492).
